 when i push 'unhome all', 'home all' is not enabled 
<Tom_L> but not the individual buttons
<Tom_L> but
<Tom_L> after unhoming the individual axis, home all appears
<Tom_L> this happens: estop on, power on, home all, mdi:X0 Y0 Z0, unhome all. Home all is still disabled
<Tom_L> then
<Tom_L> home x y z, unhome all is active: unhome all again and home all is active then
<Tom_L> a particular sequence
<Tom_L> i put the ui & ini up if you want to test it

the stop fail sequence is: estop on, power on, home all, file open, run program,
stop. run program is disabled on the menu bar

also with that, all manual buttons & mdi are left disables
<Tom_L> disabled

part of the time the yellow line isn't displaying in the gcode window but i haven't tried to pinpoint that yet

it steps to the tool change then goes to pause
step, step to get to the tool change, click ok and 'pause'
