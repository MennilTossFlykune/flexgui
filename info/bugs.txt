the stop fail sequence is: estop on, power on, home all, file open, run program,
stop. run program is disabled on the menu bar

also with that, all manual buttons & mdi are left disabled

part of the time the yellow line isn't displaying in the gcode window but i
haven't tried to pinpoint that yet

it steps to the tool change then goes to pause
step, step to get to the tool change, click ok and 'pause'
